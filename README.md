# Generative AI & LLM Workshop

This repository contains my learning notes from a **Generative AI workshop** by  
**Coding Ninjas in collaboration with IIT Delhi**.

# Key concepts I learned:

 -LLMs (Large Language Models): How modern AI models generate human-like responses

 -RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation): Enhancing LLM responses using external knowledge sources

 -LangChain: Building LLM-powered applications by chaining prompts, tools, and models

 -LangGraph: Designing structured, state-based workflows for complex AI reasoning

# AI Workflow Execution:
→ RAG → Decision (Can Answer?) → Web Search → Final Answer to User

This workshop gave me a clear understanding of how modern AI assistants are designed and executed in practical applications.

Thank you Coding Ninjas and IIT Delhi for this valuable learning experience.

🚀 Looking forward to applying these concepts in future projects.
